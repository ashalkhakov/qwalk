- PCX import.
- Rewrite the padded texcoord system (again).
- Merge meshes with different textures.
- Keep compressed MDL vertex coordinates, indices, etc. intact in the case of
  importing, processing & exporting an MDL (don't want any "drift", and don't
  want the vertices unnecessarily split up).
- MDLs with a skin width not multiple of 4 should be padded.
- Command for drawing wireframe lines on the skin.
- Fix the image resize function to work when scaling up.
- Allow importing alternate palettes for MDLs.
- Allow configuration of the fullbright rules when downsampling to the palette
  when exporting MDLs. Possibly just import the colormap, and tell it to ignore
  fullbrights.
- Implement skingroups and framegroups somehow.
- Write an MD2 writer.
- Generate MD2 glcmds.
- Write an MD3 writer.
- Do air-tight error checking to avoid all potential crashes (and detect all
  invalid data imported models).
